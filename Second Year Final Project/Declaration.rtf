I did not collaborate with anyone in this project but i did use a LLM to help me in this project. \
\
in problem 2 i used chat gpt and asked it to explain to explain what different loops where doing in simple english to make sure i was looping over the correct stuff. \
\
in problem 4 i used it and added comments to explain my code so that readers of the blog can understand the code without me having to explain code in the blog. \
